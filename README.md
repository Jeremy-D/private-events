# private events
This is a project to practice data modeling with Rails. The idea is to build something similar to eventbrite. Users can create events, send invittions and manage signups. Users can attend many events. Meaning we'll use many to many relationships. See a description of the project [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/associations).
